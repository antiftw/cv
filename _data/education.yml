      Unable to finish due to financial reasons. Was very insigthful and learned a lot about techniques
      that were not taught in my BSc, such as Computer Vision, Computer Animation and a broad array of Game Development
      techniques. I did also realize that I was more interested in building software than in building games.
    languages:
      - C++
      - OpenGL

    thesis:
      title: "Kernel Machines for Multi-Class Classification: A Joint Kernel Approach"
      subject: |
        In this thesis we applied Machine Learning to find patterns in datasets. 
        We are able to train an algorithm to make predictions about new data coming from the same source. 
        We do this by using different algorithms and compare the results to see if any outperform the other. 
        We also made some variations in one of the algorithms, namely RLS (Regularized Least Squares), 
        to see if that makes any significant changes in performance.

      Learned a lot about the Computer Science foundations, like the foundational mathematics such as Linear Algebra 
      and Calculus but also relevant theory - such as Computational Complexity - that is used to engineer and develop 
      robust, maintainable and efficient software. I was also introduced to a broad array of programming languages,
      which made me realize that there is no such thing as the best programming language, but that each language has
      its own strengths and weaknesses. I also learned that it is important to know the right tool for the job.
    languages:

      - C#
