      An <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/graveyardkeeper/mods/29">adaptation</a> 
      of the NotKeepersNeeds mod for Graveyard Keeper to enable it to run on newer versions of the game,
      as well as some minor bugfixes and other improvements.
  - title: docker-automysqlbackup

      A <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/antiftw/docker-automysqlbackup">fork</a> that adds 
      WebDav support to an existing project of a Docker container for AutoMysqlBackup to be able to backup MySQLs 
      databases directly to a WebDav server.
