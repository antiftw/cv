      Develop myself as an IT professional to be able to handle 
      a broad spectrum of problems related to Computer Science. 
      Growing up as a son of a father who taught himself everything 
      he knows about computers and the field, I was naturally drawn to it. 
      Because of this, I decided at a young age to study Computer Science 
      as far as I could. 

      So, choosing the additional course of Computer Science at my middle 
      school was an obvious choice. After that I finished my BSc in this 
      field and almost finished my MSc. Due to financial reasons I wasn't 
      able to finish this, and since then I am looking for the right 
      challenge to apply my skills and satisfy my interests.

      I take joy in finding solutions to problems and I've always been 
      actively researching new methods and techniques in my personal time
      to help create these solutions in a robust, elegant and efficient way. 
      As of yet I have not encountered a problem to which I was unable to find 
      a satisfying solution.

      Recently I have been familiarizing myself with Docker and Test Driven Development (TDD). 
      To this end, I am now running my personal server, a Raspberry PI - which runs a WebDAV-, 
      mail- and web- server - using separate Docker containers behind a reverse proxy. 
      I'm also in the process of rewriting my personal website using the TTD methodology and 
      such that it uses the client-server architecture, having a Symfony back-end which is 
      accessed by an Angular front-end through a REST API. For the next step I would like 
      to research and implement a CI/CD pipeline to automate the deployment process.
