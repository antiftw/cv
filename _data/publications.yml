      This paper was written as a part of my Bachelor Thesis.
      It proposes an algorithm for eﬃcient remote homology detection.
      Unlike many other methods our multi-class classiﬁcation algorithm uses
      a co-regularization framework and allows construction of expressive features on
      input-output spaces. Furthermore, it leads to notable decrease in training time
      compared to algorithms that treat remote homology detection as a set of binary
      classiﬁcation problems.
